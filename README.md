# Raymarching-Demo

This is a project I originaly worked on in Objective-C and OpenGL and then converted to JavaScript and WebGL.
The code in the shaders is from various projects I found on the web. The code did not come with a license. Also The Scene() 
function and the sine wave for the sphere-box is from me.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move between demos and the up arrow for a surprise!
